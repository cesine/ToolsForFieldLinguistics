\abstract{This is an abstract of what this paper is about. This collection of latex source started in 2003 from reading a LaTEX for Everyone by Jane Hahn (published in 1993).  Since then, a number of commands had changed in \LaTeXe{}. This document contains the latest commands  (to my knowledge) as of Feb 2008. This document is designed to contain tons of Latex examples that a linguist can copy and paste into their own documents, it should also help with a bit of theory so you can learn how to get the packages you need to run the code, and you can learn how to  tweek the example code by looking up the documentation for those packages, or for LaTeX in general. It should get you up and running as a good mentor should. As you read the .pdf output of this .tex file you can bounce back and forth between the output (.pdf) and the source (.tex) to see how the output was coded. LaTeX is certainly one of the easiest programming languages you can learn. Essentially,  almost all latex comands are 1 place predicates that start with a slash and take one obligatory argument in curly braces \{arg\} and perhaps optional (comma seperated) arguments in square brackets [arg1,arg2,arg3], take a look at the code to see some examples}

\part{Instalation}
\section{How to use LaTeX}

You can use Latex on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

LaTeX is a type of programming language for formating scientific texts/books. It's not a Word Processor (like Microsoft Word, WordPad or WordPerfect). In fact, all word processers save their documents in a code that is readable by that application. LaTex is like this code, its a level deeper than what you view, and allows you more control over the document than a Word Processor. 

LaTex makes it very easy to draw uniform diagrams and write forumlas using plain text. If you already know a bit about HTML or any other programming language this will be easy for you.

There are 3 steps to making a file in LaTeX.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Edit a plain text file.
   \item run LaTex to proccess the file.
   \item view the output (there are three formats for the output, dvi, ps, pdf. there are differences that will be discussed later). 
\end{itemize}

After you are finished your document it will exist as a .pdf 

LaTex began on the Linux operating system. So the installation for Linux users is very common and there are plenty of explainations online. Similarly Mac OS X is actually based off of Linux, so its also common to install Latex on a Mac. 


\subsubsection{Linux Instalation}

teTex is no longer supported (2006) instead use texlive.

create a user directory to put your own sty files


cd ~
mkdir -p texmf/tex/latex/foo

Now, we must make LaTeX recognize the new package:

texhash ~/texmf

\subsection{Windows instalation}
Since running Latex on Microsoft Windows is the most complicated, I will explain a way to install LaTeX on a MS Windows machine. (If you have a Mac you can try http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/)



Getting \LaTeX to run on windows can be annoying. As of March 2008 here is something that works:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Download MikTex (the distribution of LaTeX for windows, for linux its teTeX, for Mac its XeTeX or something like that), 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item download and open a file similar to setup-2.7.2904.exe This file is both for downloading, and for installing. 
			\item First choose the Download MiKTex, then choose Basic (it takes less time to download) or choose Complete (this is better if you can do it, because you will have less problems installing packages later) 
			\item Choose a source to download from (the sources in the united states are not reliable and quit downloading in the middle, the sources from canada and austria work pretty well. if the source stops downloading in the middle you can just repeat the same process and it will skip the files that it has already sucessfully downloaded and continue to download where it left off.)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Install MikTex using the same file as before: setup-2.7.2904.exe
	\item Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) a centralized place to edit your LaTex source, and view the output(s) in DVI, PS or PDF format. There are two options I know about: TeXnicCenter (a file named something like TXCSetup\_1Beta7\_01.exe) and TexMaker, but I've had far more errors and trouble using TexMaker, so I like TeXnicCenter better. 
	\item Install Ghostscript and Ghostview (do an internet search for them and how to install them)
	\item Open a .tex file using the IDE (TeXnixCenter), browse around and try to latex it 
	\item Install packages that you need (often if you need a package a box will pop up when you latex the file which will ask you to download the file. This might work. But, a surefire way to install packages is to go to $Start>>Programs>>MiKTeX>>Browse Packages$ )
	\item If you have packages that you want to use, but they aren't downloadable (ie, you made them or someone else made them) then you can go  $Start>>Programs>>MiKTeX>>Settings$ again you should browse around and become familiar with the options. Choose the Roots tab, this is a list of directories where the packages (.sty files) can be saved. Basically you can put your .sty files into C:\\Local TeX Files , then go the General tab in the Settings box, and click on Refresh FNDB (this refreshes the database of packages, and it should find your new packages)
	\item Try editing your .tex document, and viewing it. You might have to explore around the IDE (TeXnicCenter) to find out how to do a spell check, how to latex the document, how to view the document, and how to change your output between  DVI, PS and PDF.
\end{itemize} 

(Note, this advice is old, from 2003 and might not be true anymore.) There are basically 4 stages to get from a .tex file to the .pdf that you can distribute. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Latex the file into a DVI (Device Independent Format) \\now the output is viewable with Yap
	\item dvips the file from dvi to ps (Post Script, a langauge that printers can read, the predecesor of pdf) \\now the output is viewable with Ghost View
	\item distill/print the document from ps to pdf (Portable Document Format) \\now the output is viewable with Adobe Reader/Professional
\end{itemize}

These extra stages have been recently bypassed using pdfTex. This makes a better pdf using modern pdf features. But, linguists use a number of packages that use ps specials (specials are arrows and lines) that can only be displayed in ps, which are then converted into images when the document is made as a pdf. 

So, for most linguistics papers we are forced to go through the 4 stages of output. If you ever have arrows and graphics that dont show up, (or error messages like ``Non-PDF special ignored!'') chances are youre using pdfTex, and you need to change some options in your IDE to get it to go through all the dvi and ps stages. You can still view the document, you will just be missing the fancy specials...

\part{Using LaTex}



\section{Here is a Section}
	\label{sec:sectioningExample} 

In this section (Section~\ref{sec:sectioningExample}) we will first see how to make sections (in \ref{sec:sectioningExample}), subsections (in \ref{sec:subsectionExample}) and subsubsections (in \ref{sec:subsubsectionExample}). In \S \ref{sec:messingWithSectioning} we will see some more advanced tools for sectioning. 

\subsection{This is a subsection}
	\label{sec:subsectionExample}


    `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
    And the mome raths outgrabe.


    ``Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
    The frumious Bandersnatch!"
    
\subsubsection{This is a subsubsection}
	\label{sec:subsubsectionExample}

    He took his vorpal sword in hand:
    Long time the manxome foe he sought--
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
    And stood awhile in thought.
    
%\subsubsubsection{There is no such thing as a subsubsubsection}	    
    
    And, as in uffish thought he stood,
    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
    And burbled as it came!

    One, two! One, two! And through and through
    The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
    He left it dead, and with its head
    He went galumphing back.

\subsubsection{Paragraphs and subparagraphs}

This is just about the headings use of pharagrahs. The spacing of pharagraphs is discussed in \S \ref{sec:spacing}.

\paragraph{This is a paragraph}

    ``And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
    He chortled in his joy.
    
\subparagraph{This is a subparagraph}

    `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
    All mimsy were the borogoves,
    And the mome raths outgrabe. 



\subsection{Advanced Sectioning: Section headings are automatically displayed in the table of contents}
	\label{sec:messingWithSectioning}

You must always tex a document twice in order to get a correct table of contents, and to get the references to be correctly evaluated. 

The table of contents will be displayed where you use the command {\verb \tableofcontents }. 


~\\
Although sections are automatically put in the Table of Contents (TOC), there are three things you can do to change this.

\begin{itemize}
	\item You can use section headings as just headings (that dont appear in the TOC and dont have a number)  with {\verb \section*{JustAHeading} }
	\item You can specify an optional arugment for the section's TOC entry (to modify/shorten a section heading) with {\verb \section[ShortVersion]{FullVersion} }
	\item You can add a non-numbered line\footnote{The addcontentsline must appear on the same page as the unnumberd heading inorder to have the right page number in the table of contents.}  in the TOC (to indicate a new Part) \\
	with {\verb \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{PartII:} }
\end{itemize} 


\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Part II: But you can mess with the Table Of Contents and Headings}

\subsubsection*{But this subsection will have no number and serves as a heading}

	To make a simple heading you can add an asterix in the code between the command and its argument (see code).

\subsubsection[Short for TOC: Occams Razor and more]{Long: Occams greatest Razor and Shaving Cream}

	This section's TOC entry is different from its heading in the text. The TOC entry is specified in an [optional argument] (see code).

\section{Cross Referenecs}

	References {\verb \ref{} }  (not to be confused with a bibliography) will take the number of the example or section that their corresponding {\verb \label{} } command is located after (look for some examples in the code). You can also do {\verb \pageref{} } For example, spacing is discussed on page~\pageref{sec:spacing}.

	Counters can be reset (counters: part, chapter, section, subsection, subsubsection, paragraph, page, equation, figure, table, footnote, enumi, enumii). See the source between the table of contents and document body, and between the body and the appendix. 
	
	You can create your  own counter with newcounter, do an internet search for more info.  % more info: http://www.personal.ceu.hu/tex/counters.htm 
	
	It helps to name your labels with a prefix depending on what they are, ie a section as sec: or example as ex: (see code for examples).

\section{How Spacing Works in LaTeX}\label{sec:spacing}


\subsection{Basic Spacing: spaces, paragraphs, tabs}	

	\LaTeX ignores spacing in your source code, it handles all the spacing for you.  	Ignoring the spacing in code is actually useful, it means you can space your code so that it is easy to read. 

	\begin{example}\label{ex:forcespacing}
	Summary of Spacing, and ways to force it\\
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Any number of blank lines will make a new paragraph (use  {\verb \\ } force a paragraph)
		\item Indentation is handled automatically (use {\verb \noindent } to force no indentation)
		\item Any number of spaces will make 1 space (use {\verb ~ } to force a space)
		\item Tabs are completely ignored. (use {\verb ~~~~~~or\hspace{.3in} } to force a tab)
	\end{itemize}
	\end{example}
	
	The tilda is also useful for things like \S~1, Section~1, Generalization~1, Figure~1, Example~1 where you dont want the `Example' and the `1' to be seperated by a line break (see code).

	
	\noindent You can get a single line break\\like this\\and this. 


\subsection{Indentation: Using quote and quotation}	
	
	The formated output (\ref{ex:formated}) was created with forced spacing. The unformated output (\ref{ex:unformated}) is what it looks like with no forced spacing: 
	

	\begin{example}\label{ex:unformated}
	Here is what an unformated `Le Jabberwock' looks like:\\ 
	
	Il \'{e}tait grilheure; les slictueux toves
	Gyraient sur l'alloinde et vriblaient:
	Tout flivoreux allaient les borogoves;
	Les verchons fourgus bourniflaient.
	
	``«Prends garde au Jabberwock, mon fils!
	A sa gueule qui mord, \`{a} ses griffes qui happent!
	Gare l`oiseau Jubjube, et laisse
	En paix le frumieux Bandersnatch!»"
	
	Le jeune homme, ayant pris sa vorpaline \'{e}p\'{e}e,
	Cherchait longtemps l`ennemi manziquais...
	Puis, arriv\'{e} près de l`Arbre T\'{e}p\'{e},
	Pour r\'{e}fl\'{e}chir un instant s'arr\^{e}tait.
	
	Or, comme il ruminait de suff\^{e}ches pensées,
	Le Jabberwock, l`oeil flamboyant,
	Ruginiflant par le bois touffet\'{e},
	Arrivait en barigoulant.
	
	Une, deux! Une, deux! D'outre en outre!
	Le glaive vorpalin virevolte, flac-vlan!
	Il terrasse le monstre, et, brandissant sa t\^{e}te,
	Il s`en retourne galomphant.
	
	``«Tu as donc tu\'{e} le Jabberwock!
	Dans mes bras, mon fils rayonnois!
	O jour frabieux! Callouh! Callock!»"
	Le vieux glouffait de joie.
	
	Il \'{e}tait grilheure; les slictueux toves
	Gyraient sur l`alloinde et vriblaient:
	Tout flivoreux allaient les borogoves;
	Les verchons fourgus bourniflaient.	
	\end{example}

	
	\begin{example} \label{ex:formated}
	Here is what `Le Jabberwock' should look like. \\
	
	\begin{quote}
		`Le Jabberwock' \\
		Translated by Henri Parisot: \\
		http://www.keithlim.com/jabberwocky/translations/index.html\\
		~\\

		Les verchons fourgus bourniflaient.\\
	\end{quote}
	\end{example}
	

	The formated output (\ref{ex:formated}) was created using quote. If you want to make a paragraph quotation you can use quotation
	
	\begin{quotation}
	
		%This immediately raises the question of how one can judge the theoretical significance of a given fact or body of facts. The answer is that this can be done by showing that the facts in question can be accounted for as consequences of laws organized in a well articulated theory\ldots
		\noindent  Unfortunately, within linguistics it has not been generally recognized how important such formal, theoretical work is; instead  there is a feeling that too much concern for theoretical detail is  a waste of time\ldots [T]he attitude that formal, theoretical work  is bound to be both ad-hoc and sterile is, I am convinced,  fundamentally mistaken \ldots 
		
		\index{hspace} \hspace{3in}Morris Halle (1975:530)
	\end{quotation}


	
\subsection{Advanced Spacing: vspace \index{vspace} and \index{hspace} hspace}\label{sec:advspacing}

You can create vertical space 

	\vspace{.6in} \index{vspace} like this. You can create horizontal space \hspace{.6in} like this. This can be useful in graphics, figures and examples. hspace can be useful in getting Trees to be smaller... but vspace and hspace are hacks that are best avoided and can have bad consequences.
	


\section{Lists and Enumeration}

\subsection{Enumerated Lists}

There are only four levels of list available. You can have an itemize list inside of an enumerated list and vice versa. See Item~\ref{list:level2}, Item~\ref{list:level3}, Item~\ref{list:level4} for examples of using references in lists.

Here is the automated way enumerated lists look

\begin{enumerate}
	\item This is the first level
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \label{list:level2} This is the second level
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \label{list:level3} This is the third level
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \label{list:level4} This is the fourth level
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
		\item This is the seecond item in the second level
	\end{enumerate}
	\item This is the second item in the first level
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Itemized Lists}

Here is the way that a normal itemized list looks. You change the bullet symbols to anything you want.

\begin{itemize}
	\item here is a bunch of embedded items
	\item buy groceries
	\begin{itemize}
		\item potatoes
		\begin{itemize}
			\item red
			\begin{itemize}
				\item russet
			\end{itemize}
			\item yellow
		\end{itemize}
		\item celery
		\item frying chicken
		\item milk
	\end{itemize}
	\item[o] Here is a changed example pay bills
	\item [$\heartsuit$] Here is a changed example do laundry
	\item [(a)] Here is a changed example using a literal (a)
	\item [OK] Here is a changed example using the word `OK'

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Descriptive Lists}

Descriptive lists are good for glossaries, and can also be used as  a quick solution for references/bibliography. 

\begin{description}
	\item [Dogs] Dogs, with their friendly obedient nature, make excellent pets. There are many differnt sizes of dogs, ranging from a bundle you can old in one hand to a 50--60 pound animal tha tbegins to resemle a horse. 
	\item [Cat etc] Cats are ideal pets for people who are on-the-go. Independent and intellegent in nature, they do not require a great deal of attention. While being well able to entertain and take care of themselves, ats also offer warmth and affection to their owners.
	\item [Birds] Birds add a splash of colour and a pleasant background music to the household. The patient bird owner can train his pet to talk and sit on his finger, and even ride around town on his shoulder.

\subsection{Formating using math mode}
Equation numbers are usually on the right, but they can be put on the left using [leqno] in the documentclass command (see the preamble in the source)
\begin{equation}
x=y+z
\label{eq:first}
\end{equation}

That was Equation~\ref{eq:first}.  (Number provided by the ref command.) And another paragraph may follow the equation. To produce the same equation without a number, type the following:

\begin{displaymath}
x=y+z
\end{displaymath}

\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x)=g(x)
\end{equation}

\[
\sum_{1}^{5}x=15
\]

Using the shorthand notation, \LaTeX will still  create \[x=y+z\] the equation in the middle of the page even though the source has the equatin in the middle of a block of text.. 

You can access math mode in the text using {\verb \math{x=y+z} } or the short cut: dollar signs \$ around the text that should be formated in math mode. \begin{math}x=y+z\end{math} $x=y+z$ this is useful for subscripts he$_i$ or T$_{past}$ and superscripts v$^o$ or v$^{intrans}$.
\LaTeX\ Can have the sums and integrals taller or shorter depending on use of hte displaystyle of textstyle. Here is an in-line integral: $\int_{0}^{1}f(x)=g(x)$, and here is an in-line summation: $\sum_{1}^{5} x =15$. They look different from the displayed forms.

Here is a bunch of text to make a paragraph to see how the tall integral will look. Here is a {\it tall} in-line integral: $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{1}f(x)=g(x)$. And here is a {\it short} displayed summation (See, they're not pretty when used in the opposite contexts. fortunatly latex will take care of that.)

\[
\textstyle \sum_{1}^ {5} x=15
\]
\begin{equation}
x=i\scriptstyle j \scriptscriptstyle k
\end{equation}

Assumption: $\gamma$ is an Individual\\
If $\gamma$ is a wuggy ball (where wuggy stands for any adjective), then\\
\hspace{.2in}it is necessarily the case that $\gamma$ is wuggy and,\\
\hspace{.2in}it is necessarily the case that $\gamma$ is a ball.\\

Assumption: $\gamma \in D_{individuals}$ \\
$\gamma \in (\denote{Adjective} \cap \denote{Noun})$\\
\hspace{.2in}$\models \gamma \in \denote{Adjective} $\\
\hspace{.2in}$\models \gamma \in \denote{Noun} $\\
(iii) In words: If $\gamma$ is a member of the intersection of sets \denote{Adjective} and \denote{Noun}, then\\
\hspace{.2in}it is necessarily the case that $\gamma$ is a member of \denote{Adjective} and \\
