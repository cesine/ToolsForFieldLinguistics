/*
 * This jape grammar transfers the <p></p> tags from the Original markups (found if the document was in HTML)
 * Reasoning: Often the <p></p> are the only sections of an HTML document where it makes sense to run a Sentence Parser.
 * 	Because the Stanford parser is slow and heavy, reducing the data reduces the run time. 
 * 
 * Tested on Wikipedia articles (Create a Gate Document by providing the URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_name)
