/*
 * Checking for systematic mistakes made when the subtitles are from SubRip, an OCR subtitler which recognizes images and turns
 * them into text. Due to Subtitle font being in Arial, SubRip often mixes up 
 * 		l and I and 
 * 		ligatures (Sh ->Dh) 
 * 
 * Below are a list of rules to correct the mistakes.
 * 
 * Ideally this process should be done by a combination of:
 * 		possible clusters in the Language, (implemented statistics rather than linguistic knowledge)
 * 		checking edit distance (phonemic, orthographic and keyboard proximity)
 *  	and probably word frequencies outside the subtitles to fix the mistakes the rules create
 *   		(often in proper names) Example: "Abu Dhabi" is correct, but the rule creates "Abu Shabi"
 * 
 * Correcting the hypercorrection:
 * 		Running a word count in this set of subtitles vs a word count in a document might identify words which are wrong due to SubRib
 * 		But it also might misidentify words which are simply popular in this movie.
