#testthat tests
# expect_that(object, condition, info = NULL, label = NULL)
# ask expect_that() to test the following conditions:
# is_true: Does the expression evaluate to TRUE?
# is_false: Does the expression evaluate to FALSE?
# is_a: Did the object inherit from a specified class?
# equals: Is the expression equal within numerical tolerance to your expected value?
# is_equivalent_to: Is the object equal up to attributes to your expected value?
# is_identical_to: Is the object exactly equal to your expected value?
# matches: Does a string match the specified regular expression?
# prints_text: Does the text thatâ€™s printed match the specified regular expression?
# throws_error: Does the expression raise an error?
# takes_less_than: Does the expression take less than a specified number of seconds to run?
